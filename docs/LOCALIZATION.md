# Localization Backlog

This file tracks English source strings that still need translation. Product implementation is English first: add or update `src/i18n/locales/en.json` during feature work, then document any untranslated keys here with enough context for later localization.

When a key is translated into every supported locale, remove its entry from this file.

## Pending Strings

No pending strings.
